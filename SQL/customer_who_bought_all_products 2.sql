-- DML 

Create table If Not Exists Customer (customer_id int, product_key int)
Create table Product (product_key int)
Truncate table Customer
insert into Customer (customer_id, product_key) values ('1', '5')
insert into Customer (customer_id, product_key) values ('2', '6')
insert into Customer (customer_id, product_key) values ('3', '5')
insert into Customer (customer_id, product_key) values ('3', '6')
insert into Customer (customer_id, product_key) values ('1', '6')
Truncate table Product
insert into Product (product_key) values ('5')
insert into Product (product_key) values ('6')


-- My Solution 

with cte as 
(
    select group_concat(distinct product_key order by product_key)product 
    from product order by product_key
),
cte2 as 
(
    select customer_id,group_concat(distinct product_key order by product_key)grp 
    from customer 
    group by customer_id order by product_key
)
select  a.customer_id from cte2 a , cte b 
where a.grp = b.product;
